# Car Companion
<br>

### Summary
Car companion is a React based web app designed to be a user friendly interface for the head unit of a car. It is designed to work on specific hardware (listed below) and some features are dependent on that hardware as it uses input from certain sensors. 

### The goals of this project
My goal with this was to test updating a website from physical exterior sensors in a creative way using React, while also offering other features one would want in a head unit.
Some of the features are local weather updates, music interface with music applications, google maps and routes, rear camera views, distance sensors, and a phone interface via blutooth. It is important to remember some of these feature will only be available on the specified hardware. 

### Sensors
The first sensors tried were ultrasionic distance sensors designed to measure distance based on a ping signal and response time. The idea here is that they would report back a distance to be parking sensors in a way. 
There is also a spot for a backup camera, which a webapp will pick up any USB based camera and use it once the COM port is opened. 

### Further Goals of this project
My future goals for this project are to polish the UI and bring this closer to something that would be a product from a store.
